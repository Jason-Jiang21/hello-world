# hello-world
My First Repository!
Hi! My name is Jason Jiang and I am currently studying Biology at USC! I was super interested in breaking into the CS field and I am considering a major switch. However, I am not fully committed yet, as I still want to see if I truly enjoy coding. I am currently taking Harvard's CS50 course to start my tech journey! Any tips would be appreciated!
